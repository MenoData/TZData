# TZData
Timezone repository based on IANA/TZDB

This project will be regularly updated when ever new versions of the IANA/TZDB are available. Just drop the newest tzdata-jar (together with time4j-core and time4j-olson) into your classpath, and you can enjoy Time4J with its own timezone repository.

TZData effectively forms a module of Time4J (https://github.com/MenoData/Time4J) and can be combined with version lines v3.x or v4.x. The latest TZData-distribution requires a minimum version of v3.5/4.3 or higher.
