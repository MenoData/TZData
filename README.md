# TZData
Timezone repository based on IANA/TZDB

This project will be regularly updated when ever new versions of the IANA/TZDB are available. Just drop the newest tzdata-jar (together with time4j-base) into your classpath or module path, and you can enjoy Time4J with its own timezone repository.

TZData effectively forms a module of Time4J (https://github.com/MenoData/Time4J). The automatic module name in Java9+-environments is "net.time4j.tzdb". Its versions (recommended v5.0-2018f or higher) can be combined with version line v5.0 or later. Older TZData-distributions are not recommended.
